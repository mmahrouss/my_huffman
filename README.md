## Motivation:

I had recently learned about Functional Programming by studying Dan Grossman's [Programming Languages courses](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages). I am really excited about functional programming and I was excited to try out Elm and I was not disappointed. I am definetely planning to do more using Elm when I have more free time.
